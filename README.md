# AssemblageFormation
R code and tree xml file for studying the temporal pattern of species addition events in New Zealand passerine assemblage. 
See details of the analysis in paper "Tracking the formation of species assemblages over time: phylogenetic reconstruction of patterns of colonisation and speciation" by Xia Hua, Robert Lanfear, Lindell Bromham.
The executable codes are in main.R
Note that these codes are examples of how to apply our framework to studying assemblage formation. The code will need to be adapted appropriately to study other assemblages.
